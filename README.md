This is my third practice project developing in blazor server. 
Using some of my C# skills, I was able to make a simple chat box where the user can type in anything and when he or she submits, then the date and time of the chatbox will appear along with the text
No database is applied to this practice project, so the chat box will not store any previous texts.
This project is designed to not take too much computational maintenance for practice purposes
